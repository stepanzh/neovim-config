# neovim-config

I'm a basic user of [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and here is my config for this charming text editor.
I usually work with Julia, Python, C and LaTeX.

My config is inspired by [Josean Martinez' YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8) and [Gilles Castel's post on snippets](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/).


## How to install

- Copy `nvim` folder to `~/.config/`, e.g. `~/.config/nvim/`
- Change path to python interpreter in `nvim/init.lua -> vim.g.python3_host_prog` (Tip: use another text editor for this.)
- Install [pynvim](https://github.com/neovim/pynvim) for the Python interpreter from `vim.g.python3_host_prog`
- If copy-paste from operating system (OS) clipboard does not work, install clipboard manager for your OS (e.g. [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) for Ubuntu 22.04)

> [!NOTE]
> **At first run**, it is normal to encounter some errors (e.g. "colorscheme not found").
> Normally, packer shall run automatically and install plugins.


## Tested environments

- MacOS 14, iTerm2
